Docker scripts
=============

docker-clean
------------
Removes leaf images, and unused containers.
Note this will attempt to delete all containers but automatically fails on any that are still running (you will see an error message, ignore it).


docker-getip
------------
Print a list of running containers with their IP addresses.
